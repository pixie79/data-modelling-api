# Cargo audit configuration
# This file allows specific advisories that are acceptable for this project

# Allow unmaintained warnings for transitive dependencies
# These are acceptable because:
# 1. They come from optional feature-gated dependencies (imageproc, datafusion)
# 2. They are unmaintained warnings, not security vulnerabilities
# 3. The crates are still functional and widely used

# Allow specific advisories that are acceptable for this project
# These are either unmaintained warnings or unavoidable transitive dependencies

# Unmaintained warnings (acceptable - crates still functional)
